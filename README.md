It´s a sample app for study several topics related to MVC, MVP and MVVM:

- **What MVC, MVP and MVVM stand for**
- **How they structure the code and why**
- **The advantages and disadvantages of each one**
- **How to know when to use which architecture**

For this project we use the Google official library for Android Architecture Components to build our MVVM architecture.
